This code requires MATLAB's **symbolic toolbox** and can be accelerated if parallel computing toolbox is available. If you would like to run OSVM illustrative example, [CVX optimization software](http://cvxr.com/) needed. 

## How to run
Please see README file at each folder on how to reproduce our results.

This code uses Alejandro Weinstein's Distance from a point to polygon MATLAB function, and "NPERMUTEK" by Matt Fig that returns Permutation of elements.
