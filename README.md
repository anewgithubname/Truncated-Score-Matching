# Truncated-Score-Matching
Code for reproducing experimental results in https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03834

This code requires MATLAB's symbolic toolbox and can be accelerated if parallel computing toolbox is available. If you would like to run OSVM illustrative example, CVX optimization software is needed. 

## How to run
Please see README file at each folder on how to reproduce our results.

Acknowledgements
This code uses Alejandro Weinstein's Distance from a point to polygon MATLAB function, and "NPERMUTEK" by Matt Fig that returns Permutation of elements.
